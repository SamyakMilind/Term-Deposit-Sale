This Project deals with a dataset containing previous year's term deposit sales.
Based on this dataset, I aimed to find the best usable Machine Learning Algorithm that can be used to find whether a person will subscribe to the upcoming Term Deposit Sale.
Before implementation of ML models/algorithms, I had to analyze and clean the data.
I have performed Univariate and Bivariate analysis to both numerical and categorical columns present in the dataset. 
Removal of unnecessary column, One hot encoding and basic preprocessing steps were completed.
User Interface is not yet implemented but, in future I am planning to implement a proper Interface to this as well.
